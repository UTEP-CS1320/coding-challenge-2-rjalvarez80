### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

I first evaluate the error possibility for d > s at the beggining so we can disqualify possible incorrect outputs. Then I start from top to bottom of the table because we were looking for a reading below an specific number. This way once we see that the s is not less than 120 and it fall on the category of less than 130 we can infer that the number is between 120 and 129 without specifing that s have to be greater than 120 because that filter was already pass. I program the last three categories from bottom to top for the same but opposite reason. Now we were evaluating a reading greater than instead of a less than.
I type 1 if statement for possible errors and 5 if-else statements for 5 different categories if the reading was not an error. With my knowledge I did the best I could do and I have no extra ideas of how to simplify my code.
